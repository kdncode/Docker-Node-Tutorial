# Node with Docker

Using Volumes And Nodemon.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/kdncode/docker-node-tutorial.git

cd docker-node-tutorial/

docker run -p 3001:3000 -v $(pwd):/app docker-node-tutorial
```

Navigate to: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

# Step by step
## Install

```
npm install

npm run start
```
Navigate to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Build Docker Image
This will subsequently run through the 6 steps outlined within our Dockerfile and build our complete Docker image.
```
docker build -t docker-node-tutorial .
```

## Run Docker Image
This will start up a Docker container based off our docker-node-tutorial docker image and expose it on port 9000 on our machine. The -d flag specifies that we wish to run this in a detached mode which means that the docker container will run in the background on our host machine.
```
docker run -d -p 9000:3000 docker-node-tutorial
```

## View running Docker Containers
This should show our docker-node-tutorial container running and the ports that itâ€™s listening to.
```
docker ps
```

## Automatically Picking up Changes
```
npm install --save nodemon

docker build -t docker-node-tutorial-tutorial .

docker run -it -p 9001:3000 -v $(pwd):/app docker-node-tutorial-tutorial
```
Navigate to: [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)
